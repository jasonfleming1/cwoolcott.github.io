Boone sits down with Texas singer/songwriter Brent Ryan (<a href="http://www.brentryanmusic.com">www.brentryanmusic.com</a>) in Luckenbach, Texas before Brent hosts the Tuesday night pickers circle. They talk about how Brent fell into this life of a active musician and the way he chooses to go about navigating his career. They also talk over the sounds of tractors, motorcycles, the live music, and crowd that is going on at the world famous Luckenbach. Brent also speaks about a new project he is starting called "bands in the black" which is geared towards an outside the box thinking pattern of how to remain successful in this business. It gets noisy at times, but hey, this is an authentic podcast from an authentic place.
