# 20.1 Lesson Plan NOTES
**Forms, Conditional Rendering & React Router**

**Global State:** State that is maintained outside of the component tree. Typically this is Redux. The state that is held here is accessible from anywhere in the application.

**Component State:** State that is held within a component and manipulated with this.setState .

**Relative State:** State that is passed from parent to child down the component tree.

**Provided State:** The state is placed into a context ( using Reactâ€™s Context API ) by a provider. It can then be consumed by components individually without the need to be passed down the component tree.

##### componentDidMount is a component lifecycle What are others
Similar to some of the DOM lifecycle events we've worked with in vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. For example, in jQuery, $(document).ready runs when the entire web page is loaded.
