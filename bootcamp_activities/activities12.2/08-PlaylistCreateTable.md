# **Instructions**

* Using database `playlist_db`, create a table inside of this database called `songs`. The songs table should have four columns:
> 
> 	Primary Key of "ID" which auto-increments
> 	
> 	A column called "title"
> 	
> 	A column called "artist"
> 	
> 	A column called â€œgenre"


* Make sure you add some songs to this table so you have actual data to work with.
