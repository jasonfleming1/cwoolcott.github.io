# **Instructions**

* We are going to print playlists to the console based upon the genre or artist.

* First create code that prints all songs within your database to the terminal.

* Now create code that prints songs of a specific genre/artist to the terminal.

* BONUS: Use 'placeholder' values or string concatenation to build a MySQL query which allows you to change pieces of the query on the fly (e.g. using a variable to build the `WHERE` clause, instead of a static string).

  * There are a couple different ways to accomplish this task, but the most common one can be found within the [documentation for the MySQL package](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql#performing-queries).
