# **Instructions**

Throughout this class we are going to be working on creating an application that takes in music data to create personalized playlists

Make sure to get as far as you can over the course of these assignments as the coding you do here will be extremely useful to you when you begin working on the homework

For now we will simply be creating your database in MySQL and then creating a connection to said database using Node.Â Remember, you must create a database before attempting to connect to it. Doing otherwise will return an error.


* Create a database called `playlist_db` in MySQL Workbench
* Create the Connection in playlist.js
